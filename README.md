### print.are.na

print.are.na was created by Mindy Seu, the Poetic Justice Group and Are.na to create small publications for Ekene Ijeomaâ€™s Black Mobility and Safety in the US course.

Evan Brooks created bindery.js, the open source library (which this version of print.are.na relies upon) to create printable books using HTML and CSS. Callil Capuozzo made the original print.are.na for the 2017 Cybernetics Conference.
